# Dense-Geometry-Supervision-for-Underwater-Depth-Estimation
This is an example of Adabins using [the module proposed in the paper](models/DepthTextureFusion.py). To put it simply, it involves passing the image through the proposed module to [obtain an enhanced texture image](EhanceImageGenModule.py), which is then fused with the features obtained from the decoder.
