# Dense-Geometry-Supervision-for-Underwater-Depth-Estimation
This is an example of Adabins using [the module proposed in the paper](models/DepthTextureFusion.py). To put it simply, it involves passing the image through the proposed module to [obtain an enhanced texture image](EhanceImageGenModule.py), which is then fused with the features obtained from the decoder.

## Environment
The runtime environment can refer to the environment of [Adabins](https://github.com/shariqfarooq123/AdaBins), including the TXT file of relevant parameters.
